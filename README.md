# Polynomials-Integer

This C++ program allows you to add, subtract, multiply, and modify polynomials with integer coefficients. You can add two polynomials together, subtract one from the other, multiply them, and even modify the first polynomial using the results of these operations.

Check out [Polynomials-Fraction](https://github.com/FarnoodID/Polynomials-Fraction) for a similar program that operates on polynomials with fractional coefficients.
